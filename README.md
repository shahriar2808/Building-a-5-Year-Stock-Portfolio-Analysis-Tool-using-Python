# Building-a-5-Year-Stock-Portfolio-Analysis-Tool-using-Python
This project analyzes a 5-year stock portfolio using Python and yFinance. It retrieves historical data for AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, TSLA, and MSFT, calculates daily returns, identifies peak return dates, and simulates an equal-weighted $10,000 portfolio to measure cumulative growth and final valuation.
